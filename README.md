### About the Experiment 
**DC Motors :**

The dc machine serves dual roles as both a generator and a motor, as depicted in Fig. 1. When functioning as a generator, mechanical power is supplied to the machine as input, yielding electrical power as output. A prime mover, such as a gas turbine, diesel engine, or electrical motor, spins the armature of the dc machine, generating dc power within it. Conversely, when utilized as a motor, electrical power is fed into the machine, resulting in mechanical power output. If the armature connects to a dc power source, the motor generates mechanical torque and power. Notably, the dc machine finds more frequent application as a motor rather than a generator. DC motors offer precise control over a wide range of speeds and torque. In both generator and motor modes, the armature winding rotates within a magnetic field, carrying current.
